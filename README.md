# wordle-solver
A universal Wordle solver that works with any language. All you need is a corpus for your language: a text file containing words, one in each line. I have so far tested this code using two corpuses: English and Russian.

Run this command to run the solver for english:

```python3 WordleSolver.py eng```

and for Russian:
```python3 WordleSolver.py rus```
